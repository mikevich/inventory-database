# How I worked on this project
My goal was to create a simple, functional inventory database tool using vanilla JS.
 * Database to have CRUD functionality with a simple, straightforward interface
 * CSV export functionality 
 * Split up tasks into modular functions for easier debugging
 * I used localStorage to store the inventory table

# How to navigate this project
I deployed this on GitHub Pages for demonstration.
 * Head to https://mikevich.github.io/inventory-database/inventory-database.html
 * Use the Add, Edit, and Delete forms to manipulate the database
 * Click Generate CSV to create a download link

# Why I built the project this way
Javascript is my primary programming language, and I wanted to create this using only Vanilla JS to test my fundamental knowledge, rather than using pre-existing libraries.

I'm currently looking to learn more about Apollo and Node.JS to further my development skills.
